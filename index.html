    <h1>Who is Jamo?</h1>
    <p>
        I am Jamie Allen, but you can call me Jamo. If you are reading this, it is likely I want to work for you and you are looking for a new hire. Well look no further, I am here. I am a 20-year-old ex-University of Bristol student who enjoys coding as a hobby. I dropped out of university because over time I realised that coding is what I actually wanted to do as a career, and my course did not involve as much pure coding as I wanted. I haven't yet picked what specifically I want to do within the field, but I have been enjoying dabbling in multiple areas, such as web development, game development, and general software engineering. The fact you can do so many things by simply typing on a keyboard is fascinating to me, and I intend to see how far I can take it.
