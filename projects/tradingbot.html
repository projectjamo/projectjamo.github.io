    <h1>TRADING BOT</h1>
    <p>
        Completed: February 2023.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        My first ever programming project. While this was objectively not a very difficult project, I am sentimental about it as it was when I first realised coding might be my<em>thing.</em> The code may not be efficient or well organised, but I took this as an opportunity to stretch my programming legs and see what I could do.

    <h1 class="headings">THE PROJECT</h1>
    <p>Skills used: Python</p>
    <br />
    <p>The goal of this project was to create a simple Caesar Cipher that could encrypt any message you passed it. I ended up creating a Caesar Cipher that would encrypt any message you passed it, with a key of your choice, that could also decrypt any message (previously encrypted with a Caesar Cipher) by testing the encrypted message against different keys and then comparing the words in the message to a dictionary of words in the English language as well as giving statistics about the message given to it.</p>
    <br />


    <h1>What went well</h1>
    <ul class="www">
        <li><p>There are many more features than were originally required in the assignment which got me a very good grade (78%). </p></li>
        <li><p>The code is well commented, I found it easy to go back to and understand while writing this.</p></li>


    </ul>
    <h1>Areas for improvement</h1>
    <ul class="improvements">
        <li><p>Add more words to the dictionary so that there is a lower chance of the code not working with shorter sentences.</p></li>
        <li><p>The capitalization of the original message is lost in the Cipher.</p></li>
